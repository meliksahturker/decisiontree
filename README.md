Decision Tree  Implementation from scratch with customizable and standardized Gini/Entropy

I implemented the Decision Tree defined in Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach book.

Gini Index is normalized so that its previous range of (0, 0.5) extends to (0, 1), matching the range of Information Gain. This allows standardization while controlling the tree depth via impurity.
